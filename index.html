                <h1>ADOPT AN ORCA</h1>
                <p>Orca are under threat in the wild from fishing nets, plastic and chemical pollution and a reduction in food stocks due to overfishing. The practice of taking individuals from the wild to be kept in cramped tanks and exploited for entertainment is also a problem.</p>
                <p>We are opposed to the keeping of orca in captivity, and work with like-minded organisations to raise awareness of the physical and mental suffering these conditions cause.</p>
